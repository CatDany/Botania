# -- MYSTICAL FLOWERS
botania.entry.flowers=Mystical Flowers
botania.page.flowers0=Around the world, you may stumble upon a large variety of Mystical Flora. Spotting these doesn't take much work as the flowers themselves emit a fair amount of shine.<br>They come in a total of &416 &0different colors.<br>It's also possible to grow these flowers using &1Floral Fertlizer&0 (read on).
botania.page.flowers1=Flowers as far as the eye can see...
botania.page.flowers2=These flowers can be plucked for &1Mystical Petals&0, that can be used for making magical instruments and plants alike.<br>These petals can also be crushed into &1Floral Powder&0, by the use of a &1Pestle and Mortar&0, which functions much alike any mundane piece of dye.

# -- PETAL APOTHECARY
botania.entry.apothecary=Petal Apothecary
botania.page.apothecary0=In order for a botanist to create plantlife that can do it's bidding, one would need special means of infusing plants with mystical energy.<br>Luckilly, the &1Petal Apothecary&0 does just that.
botania.page.apothecary1=The &1Petal Apothecary&0.
botania.page.apothecary2=This block, when placed in the world and given some water (by use of a &1Water Bucket&0), will accept any &1Mystical Petals&0 thrown at it, releasing their energies.<br>Once one has set the correct petals in, throwing some &1Seeds&0 in will finalize the proccess.<br>Tossing in the full bucket will also fill the recipient with water.
botania.page.apothecary3=Quite a few plants can be made using this method, for more information, read on the &4Functional Flora&0 and &4Generation Flora&0 sections of this Lexicon.<br>Last but not least, shift-right clicking the &1Petal Apothecary&0 with an empty hand will remove the last item thrown in.

# -- WAND OF THE FOREST
botania.entry.wand=Wand of the Forest
botania.page.wand0=The general multi-use tool for a botanist is the &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>This wand, made by, effectively, strapping a pair of &1Mystical Petals&0 of any color to a few &1Livingwood Twigs&0, is required for a good amount of tasks.
botania.page.wand1=The petals used determine the colors of the wand

# -- RUNIC ALTAR
botania.entry.runeAltar=Runic Altar
botania.page.runeAltar0=&1Runes&0 are extremely important components of complex magical devices or flora.<br>In order to create these, one would require a &1Runic Altar&0.<br>To utilize this &1Runic Altar&0, start by placing, via either a right click or simply tossing, the components to the rune you want to create.
botania.page.runeAltar1=Proceed by linking a &1Mana Spreader&0 to the altar, and right click it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0.<br>It should be apparent when the altar has received enough &4Mana&0. When that happens, just drop a piece of &1Livingrock&0 on top of it and use the wand on it again to collect your rune.
botania.page.runeAltar2=Crafting the &1Runic Altar&0.
botania.page.runeAltar3=A total of 16 &1Runes&0 exist.<br>The most basic and elementary runes are named after the &4Four Elements&0. The intermediate runes are named after the &4Four Seasons&0, and the most advanced runes are named after the &4Seven Deadly Sins&0. A separate &1Rune of Mana&0 also exists.
botania.page.runeAltar20=Last but not least, sneaking and right-clicking the &1Runic Altar&0 with an empty hand while it's not accepting mana will remove the last item put into it.

# -- TERRASTEEL
botania.entry.terrasteel=Terrasteel
botania.page.terrasteel0=&1Terrasteel&0 is a powerful metal infused with the magic of nature.<br>Creating this metal proves to not be a short order, in order to create it, toss a &1Manasteel Ingot&0, a &1Mana Pearl&0 and a &1Mana Diamond&0 on top of an &4Active &1Beacon&0. A &1Mana Pool&0 must be present nearby, being at least half full. The infusion will create a single &1Terrasteel Ingot&0.
botania.page.terrasteel1=Creating &1Terrasteel&0
botania.page.terrasteel2=By combining the &1Terrasteel&0 with a &1Nether Star&0 and &1Blaze Powder&0, it's possible to artificially create a small extract of &1Essence of Eternal Life&0, a very powerful component in the creation of magical flora and natural instruments.
botania.page.terrasteel3=These come not from Kyubey

# - MANA
# -- AN INTRODUCTION TO MANA
botania.entry.mIntro=An Introduction to Mana
botania.page.mIntro0=&4Mana&0 is an ethereal substance. In layman's terms, it is a form of &4mystical energy&0. Its sensorial existence is inconstant, and its color depends on the environment its put in.<br>Mastering &4Mana&0 is one of the most important skills a botanist needs to master.
botania.page.mIntro1=In order to create &4Mana&0, one would require a set of &4Generating Flowers&0 (read the respective section). This &4Mana&0 can be dispersed by utilizing &1Mana Spreaders&0 and stored in &1Mana Pools&0. &4Mana&0 can be used for a myriad of different things. For starters, it can be used for &4Functional Flowers&0 (read the respective section).
botania.page.mIntro2=To get started with mastering the art of &4Mana&0, one would start by learning how to use &1Dayblooms&0, &1Mana Spreaders&0 and &1Mana Pools&0.<br>These form a basic infrastructure for mana, which can be used for all sorts of purposes. Have a read at the &4Functional Flora&0 and &4Magical Apparatus&0 sections of this Lexicon. 

# -- MANA SPREADER
botania.entry.spreader=Mana Spreader
botania.page.spreader0=The &1Mana Spreader&0 is the most important component in manipulating &4Mana&0.<br>This is the block that allows &4Mana&0 to travel from point A to point B. When this block is placed on the ground, it'll face one of 6 basic directions. By holding shift-right on it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, one can orient it to the opposite of where it was clicked.
botania.page.spreader10=Simply shift-right clicking once with the &1Wand of the Forest&0 on it once will bind the wand to it, holding shift-right click elsewhere will orient the spreader to that point. Shift-right clicking the spreader again unbinds it from the wand.<br>This method isn't quite perfect, by which the spreader's orientation might get distorted, for accurate movement use the method described in the last page.
botania.page.spreader1=Holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0
botania.page.spreader2=The &1Mana Spreader&0 has a small internal buffer of &4Mana&0, which will get filled by nearby &4Generating Flowers&0. This buffer can be viewed by looking at the &1Spreader&0 with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, as demonstrated in the last page.<br>Note that the block needs to be right clicked with a wand to get accurate and adequate values.  
botania.page.spreader3=Holding a &1Wand of the Forest&0 displays a beam which shows where the spreader is pointing at. Hovering over it shows the target. The sparkle that's always shown is the point when &4Mana loss&0 starts to happen.<br>If the target of the spreader is a block that can contain &4Mana&0, and isn't full, the spreader will fire a &4Mana Burst&0, which will travel to the target, and pass the &4Mana&0 along to it.
botania.page.spreader4=The spreader only fires one burst at once, it'll only fire another one when the last one hits the target.<br>Furthermore, the bursts also start suffering &4mana loss&0 after a small amount of time. This can be seen in the beam, which becomes a lot thinner when this happens. There is also a small amount of &4mana loss&0 when a beam enters a spreader.
botania.page.spreader5=Crafting the &1Mana Spreader&0
botania.page.spreader6=In order to upgrade the potential of the spreader, one can apply &1Mana Lenses&0. The very basic mana lens does absolutely nothing.<br>Lenses can be &4dyed&0 all the 16 colors of the spectrum, or combined with a &1Mana Pearl&0 to create a &1Rainbow Lens&0. These will change the color of the burst.
botania.page.spreader7=The basic lens, it doesn't do anything...
botania.page.spreader8=&4Dying&0 lenses!
botania.page.spreader9=&1Rainbow Lens&0 all the way

# -- MANA POOL
botania.entry.pool=Mana Pool
botania.page.pool0=The &1Mana Pool&0 is, simply put, a storage of &4Mana&0.<br>Mana can be inserted into it by usage of a &1Mana Spreader&0, and any adjacent &1Mana Spreaders&0 will pull mana from it to increase their internal buffer automatically.<br>Any &4Functional Flowers&0 require a nearby &1Mana Pool&0 to draw power from.
botania.page.pool1=Making the &1Mana Pool&0.
botania.page.pool2=Tossing in some resources into the Mana Pool will cause them to get infused with &4Mana&0, turning them into more powerful forms.<br>A few examples are &1Iron Ingots&0 or &1Mystical Petals&0.<br>&4Mana&0 reading for this block functions like the &1Mana Spreader&0. A &1Redstone Comparator&0 can also output a signal based on the contents.
botania.page.pool8=For the artistic types, tossing any color of &1Floral Powder&0 in the pool will have it take it's color, all sixteen colors are viable for decoration and/or easy labelling.
botania.page.pool3=Infusing &1Manasteel&0
botania.page.pool4=Infusing &1Mana Pearls&0
botania.page.pool5=Infusing &1Mana Diamonds&0
botania.page.pool6=Infusing &1Mana Petals&0
botania.page.pool7=&1Mana Cookies&0 feed you pretty well.

# -- MANA DISTRIBUTOR
botania.entry.distributor=Mana Distributor
botania.page.distributor0=Any botanist will eventually reach a point where a single &1Mana Pool&0 setup is not enough.<br>The &1Mana Distributor&0 will fix all those issues. By placing it adjacently to a few &1Mana Pools&0 on its sides, when it receives &4Mana&0 through &4Mana Bursts&0 it'll equally spread it to the adjacent pools. 
botania.page.distributor1=Crafting the distributor

# -- MANA VOID
botania.entry.manaVoid=Mana Void
botania.page.manaVoid0=The &1Mana Void&0 is, in layman's terms, the grave for &4Mana&0. Any &4Mana&0 shot into this block will simply vanish into the void, never to be seen again.<br>Placing one of these under a &1Mana Pool&0 allows the pool to always accept &4Mana&0, but disposing any it can't hold.
botania.page.manaVoid1=Crafting the void block

# -- MANA LENS: VELOCITY
botania.entry.lensVelocity=Mana Lens: Velocity
botania.page.lensVelocity0=The &1Velocity Lens&0 will drastically increase the speed at which a &4Mana Burst&0 travels, but not only does the beam start to lose it's &4Mana&0 a lot faster, it can also carry a bit less.
botania.page.lensVelocity1=Crafting the lens

# -- MANA LENS: POTENCY
botania.entry.lensPotency=Mana Lens: Potency
botania.page.lensPotency0=The &1Potency Lens&0 will double the amount of &4Mana&0 a &4Mana Burst&0 can carry, however, the beam becomes slower and after it starts to lose mana it does so at a lot faster rate.
botania.page.lensPotency1=Crafting the lens 

# -- MANA LENS: RESISTANCE
botania.entry.lensResistance=Mana Lens: Resistance
botania.page.lensResistance0=The &1Resistance Lens&0 will significantly increase the amount of time the &4Mana Burst&0 can go without starting to lose &4Mana&0, but it makes it a a bit slower.
botania.page.lensResistance1=Crafting the lens 

# -- MANA LENS: EFFICIENCY
botania.entry.lensEfficiency=Mana Lens: Efficiency
botania.page.lensEfficiency0=The &1Efficiency Lens&0 will decrease the amount of time it takes for the &4Mana Burst&0 to start losing its &4Mana&0, but when that happens, it does so at a lot slower rate.
botania.page.lensEfficiency1=Crafting the lens 

# -- MANA LENS: BOUNCE
botania.entry.lensBounce=Mana Lens: Bounce
botania.page.lensBounce0=The &1Bounce Lens&0 will allow the &4Mana Burst&0 to bounce off walls, rather than dissipating on a collision.
botania.page.lensBounce1=Crafting the lens

# -- MANA LENS: GRAVITY
botania.entry.lensGravity=Mana Lens: Gravity
botania.page.lensGravity0=The &1Gravity Lens&0 makes the &4Mana Burst&0 be attracted by the world's gravitational pull, thus moving in an arc. As compensation, it also slightly increases the time before &4Mana&0 loss starts to happen.
botania.page.lensGravity1=Crafting the lens 

# -- MANA LENS: BORE
botania.entry.lensBore=Mana Lens: Bore
botania.page.lensBore0=The &1Bore Lens&0 charges the &4Mana Burst&0 with the ability to break any blocks it comes into contact with, draining its own mana to do so.<br>Since this relies on the detection abilities of a &1Mana Spreader&0, it won't fire at just anything, as it needs a &4Mana&0 receving block in the end.
botania.page.lensBore1=Crafting the lens 

# -- MANA LENS: DAMAGING
botania.entry.lensDamaging=Mana Lens: Damaging
botania.page.lensDamaging0=The &1Damaging Lens&0 charges the &4Mana Burst&0 with the power to damage any living beings it comes across, draining its own mana to do so.<br>Since this relies on the detection abilities of a &1Mana Spreader&0, it won't fire at just anything, as it needs a &4Mana&0 receving block in the end.
botania.page.lensDamaging1=Crafting the lens

# -- MANA LENS: PHANTOM
botania.entry.lensPhantom=Mana Lens: Phantom
botania.page.lensPhantom0=By utilizing the spacetime continuum tearing properties of the &1Force Relay&0, it's possible to make a lens that'll allow the &4Mana Burst&0 to pass through blocks. In doing so, the time it can stay without losing mana is decreased.
botania.page.lensPhantom1=Crafting the lens

# -- MANA LENS: MAGNETIZING
botania.entry.lensMagnet=Mana Lens: Magnetizing
botania.page.lensMagnet0=The &1Magnetizing Lens&0, as its name states, allows the &4Mana Burst&0 to magnetize, or home in, on any nearby blocks that can receive &4Mana&0. Doing so slightly decreases the speed of the burst.
botania.page.lensMagnet1=Crafting the lens

# -- MANA LENS: ENTROPIC
botania.entry.lensExplosive=Mana Lens: Entropic
botania.page.lensExplosive0=The &1Entropic Lens&0 imbues the &4Mana Burst&0 with entropy, causing it to release its energy in the form of an explosion when it collides against something that can't receive &4Mana&0.<br>Since this relies on the detection abilities of a &1Mana Spreader&0, it won't fire at just anything, as it needs a &4Mana&0 receving block in the end.
botania.page.lensExplosive1=Crafting the lens

# -- PORTABLE MANA TRANSPORT
botania.entry.manaTransport=Portable Mana Transport
botania.page.manaTransport0=While using &1Mana Spreaders&0 to transport &4Mana&0 around is all well and good, there is also a way of doing it in a different manner.<br>The &1Mana Tablet&0 is a portable object which can carry &4Mana&0 on itself.
botania.page.manaTransport1=Tossing one of these on top of a &1Mana Pool&0 will allow for transport of &4Mana&0 between one and another.<br>Shift-right clicking the &1Mana Pool&0 with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will change in which way the &4Mana&0 flows.<br>Lastly, unlike normal items, these will never despawn when dropped on the floor.
botania.page.manaTransport2=This doesn't run android
botania.page.manaTransport3=It's also possible to indirectly access the &4Mana&0 reserves of a &1Mana Pool&0, through using a &1Mana Mirror&0, items will pull out of the pool itself.<br>To bind a mirror to a pool, one would simply &4shift right-click&0 a pool with the mirror.<br>The mirror can't put mana in or take mana out of pools in any other way.
botania.page.manaTransport4=Mirror mirror on the wall...

# -- MANA DETECTOR
botania.entry.manaDetector=Mana Detector
botania.page.manaDetector0=A device like the &1Mana Detector&0 is capable to detect when a &4Mana Burst&0 starts flowing through it (the burst doesn't dissipate on collision with this block) and provide a redstone signal when that is the case.
botania.page.manaDetector1=Crafting the detector

# -- COMPOSITE MANA LENSES
botania.entry.compositeLens=Composite Mana Lenses
botania.page.compositeLens0=Having a single &1Mana Lens&0 in a spreader just isn't enough sometimes. By combining two lenses with a &1Slimeball&0 in a crafting table, it's possible to unite them into one, and keep the effects of both.<br>The first lens used determines the visuals (texture and color). It's to note that some combinations will not work, and that two lenses of the same type can't be stacked.

# -- REDSTONE MANA SPREADER
botania.entry.redstoneSpreader=Redstone Mana Spreader
botania.page.redstoneSpreader0=By combining a &1Mana Spreader&0 with a piece of &1Redstone&0, it's possible to create a &1Redstone Mana Spreader&0, which fires only when given a &4Redstone signal&0, regardless of having a block in the end to put the mana or not.<br>It's to keep in note that this doesn't let the spreader shoot a burst until the last one dissipates or is absorbed.
botania.page.redstoneSpreader1=Just add redstone

# -- MANASTAR
botania.entry.manastar=Manastar
botania.page.manastar0=The imprecise measurements of the &1Wand of the Forest&0 sometimes won't cut it for telling if you're turning a profit or loss in your &1Mana Pools&0.<br>Creating a &1Manastar&0 and placing it next to your pools will have it shine red if there's a loss or blue if there's a profit. The measurement happens every few seconds.
botania.page.manastar1=&rI'm a shooting star leaping through the skies&r.

# - FUNCTIONAL FLOWERS
# -- AN INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTION
botania.entry.fIntro=An Introduction to Function
botania.page.fIntro0=There are various places in which the &4Mana&0 a botanist generates can be put to use, one of them is an assortment of &4Functional Flowers&0.<br>These flowers will drain &4Mana&0 from a nearby &1Mana Pool&0 into themselves, in order to do whatever task they were created for.<br>It's to note that these can't receive power directly through &1Mana Spreaders&0.
botania.page.fIntro1=All &4Functional Flowers&0, alike the &4Generating Flowers&0 contain a small buffer of &4Mana&0.<br>Standard rules for &4Mana&0 reading apply, right clicking with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will update the mana readings.
botania.page.fIntro2=It is important to keep in mind that these flowers memorize the &1Mana Pool&0 from which they should pull &4Mana&0 out of. They'll only pull from the nearest pool present at the time of the flower being placed (or the closest placed afterward, if none was present), and none other, unless that one is removed.
botania.page.fIntro3=Lastly, some functional flowers utilize a &1Redstone Root&0 in their creation. If they do, the flower's effect can be toggled with a redstone signal.
botania.page.fIntro4=&1Redstone Root&0 for Redstone Control

# -- JADED AMARANTHUS
botania.entry.jadedAmaranthus=Jaded Amaranthus
botania.page.jadedAmaranthus0=Everyone likes flowers right? The &1Jaded Amaranthus&0 is made just for that purpose.<br>Feeding it with &4Mana&0 from &1Mana Pools&0 will have it quickly grow new &1Mystical Flowers&0 around it, in any spots it can.

# -- ORECHID
botania.entry.orechid=Orechid
botania.page.orechid0=While going mining is all good, a renewable means of getting ore is due. The &1Orechid&0 will use (a massive amount of) &4Mana&0 to generate &4ores&0 in nearby &1Stone&0 blocks.<br>The ores it generates are random, but seem to be biased towards more common ores rather than rarer ones.
botania.page.orechid1=&oLizbeth would like this flower&r.

# -- FALLEN KANADE
botania.entry.fallenKanade=Fallen Kanade
botania.page.fallenKanade0=The &1Fallen Kanade&0 is a flower with angelic properties, it'll use &4Mana&0 from nearby &4Mana Pools&0 in order to apply a regeneration effect to any &4players&0 nearby.

Giving it &4Mana&0 is optional, but it'll increase it's range.<br>Items picked up will be put in adjacent inventories (e.g. &1Chests&0). Placing &1Item Frames&0 in any of the inventories will specify which items can or can't go in them.
botania.page.hopperhock1=Any inventory which has no &1Item Frame&0 adjacent to it can accept any items, but labeled inventories will take priority.<br>The rule using to sort items can be changed by shift-right clicking the flower with a &1Wand of the Forest&0.

# - GENERATING FLOWERS
# -- AN INTRODUCTION TO GENERATION
botania.entry.gIntro=An Introduction to Generation
botania.page.gIntro0=&4Generating Mana&0 should be at the top of the priorities for any botanist. Luckily there's an array of &4Generating Flowers&0 willing to do the job.<br>These flowers, as their name shows, generate &4Mana&0, both passively and actively. Unless stated otherwise, all &4Generating Flowers&0 generate &4Mana&0 passively under certain circunstances.
botania.page.gIntro1=All &4Generating Flowers&0, alike the &4Functional Flowers&0 contain a small buffer of &4Mana&0.<br>Standard rules for &4Mana&0 reading apply, right clicking with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 will update the mana readings.<br>This mana will be stored in the closest &1Mana Spreader&0 around.
botania.page.gIntro2=It is important to keep in mind that these flowers memorize the &1Mana Spreader&0 into which they should put &4Mana&0 into. They'll only store into the nearest spreader present at the time of the flower being placed (or the closest placed afterward, if none was present), and none other, unless that one is removed.

# -- DAYBLOOM
botania.entry.daybloom=Daybloom
botania.page.daybloom0=The &1Daybloom&0 is the most basic and rudimentary &4Generating Flower&0. Simply put, it preforms a modified photosythesis process, in order to transform sunlight into &4Mana&0.<br>The process is rather slow, about ten or a dozen of these should get the job done, for now.
botania.page.daybloom1=An interesting thing to take in note is that these flowers tend to compete among themselves for what sunlight hits an area, thus having any others adjacent to it on any of the four cardinal directions will result in diminshing returns of &4Mana&0 production.
botania.page.daybloom2=&oStarting up a brand new day&r.

# -- NIGHTSHADE
botania.entry.nightshade=Nightshade
botania.page.nightshade0=The &1Nightshade&0 is the dark counterpart of the &1Daybloom&0, as it generates &4Mana&0 passively in any situation the &1Daybloom&0 can not, albeit at half the speed.<br>Similarly to their shining counterpart, they suffer diminishing returns from having any adjacent.
botania.page.nightshade1=&oThe shadow of the day&r.

# -- ENDOFLAME
botania.entry.endoflame=Endoflame
botania.page.endoflame0=While the &1Daybloom&0 is all well and good, a botanist requires more effective means of generating &4Mana&0.<br>The &1Endoflame&0 does that exactly, it will absorb any combustible items or blocks dropped on the nearby vacinity (albeit only one at a time) and burn through them to passively generate mana while the fuel lasts.
botania.page.endoflame1=There is a small caveat though, the &1Endoflame&0 will not burn anything that returns a bi-product, an example are &1Lava Buckets&0, that have empty &1Buckets&0 as a bi-product.
botania.page.endoflame2=&oNot nitor&r.

# -- HYDROANGEAS
botania.entry.hydroangeas=Hydroangeas
botania.page.hydroangeas0=While passive &4Mana&0 generation can be easilly achieved through &1Dayblooms&0, different means of doing so might come in handy. The &1Hydroangeas&0 will suck up any &1Still Water&0 in a 3x3 area around it, on the same height, creating &4Mana&0 from it.<br>It also seems to function faster during &4Rain&0, who'd have thought?
botania.page.hydroangeas1=&oFrom some Hyperdimension&r?

# -- THERMALILY
botania.entry.thermalily=Thermalily
botania.page.thermalily0=There comes a point where slow generating power, like the &1Hydroangeas&0 or the &1Endoflame&0 is not enough. An answer to that is the &1Thermalily&0, which works similarly to the &1Hydroangeas&0, except with &1Lava&0. Care should be taken with this flower, as it generates power at an extremely fast speed.
botania.page.thermalily1=&oLily ought to know&r.

# -- ROSA ARCANA
botania.entry.arcanerose=Rosa Arcana
botania.page.arcanerose0=&4Experience Points&0 are a form of magic of sorts. The &1Rosa Arcana&0 can tap into it and absorb the experience of players on the ground around it, turning it into &1Mana&0.

# -- MUNCHDEW
botania.entry.munchdew=Munchdew
botania.page.munchdew0=Generating the form of natural energy that is &4Mana&0 should be a pretty good process when done via other living materials. By using the &1Munchdew&0, any &1Leaves&0 near the flower will get munched up and convereted into &4Mana&0.<br>It's to note that, though, no saplings or any other items will be dropped from the leaves.
botania.page.munchdew1=&oItadakimasu&r!

# -- ENTROPINNYUM
botania.entry.entropinnyum=Entropinnyum
botania.page.entropinnyum0=In order to generate a blast of &4Mana&0, one might in fact, require a blast nearby.<br>Igniting a block of &1TNT&0 in the near an &1Entropinnyum&0 will have the latter absorb all the entropy generated by the blast into itself, creating a large amount of &4Mana&0 and nullifiying any possible damage. Lastly, to absorb the explosion, the flower must not have any &4Mana&0 stored in it or the process will fail.
botania.page.entropinnyum1=&oCool guys don't look at explosions&r.

# -- KEKIMURUS
botania.entry.kekimurus=Kekimurus
botania.page.kekimurus0=&1Cake&0 is delicious, everyone loves it, flowers included.<br>The &1Kekimurus&0 is one of these &1Cake&0 aficionados, and will eat any it spots nearby, using it's enriching nutrients to create &4Mana&0.

# - MAGICAL APPARATUS
# -- FORCE RELAY
botania.entry.pistonRelay=Force Relay
botania.page.pistonRelay0=It seems that infusing &1Pistons&0 with &4Mana&0 results in some interesting adverse effects.<br>This block tears the fabric of space, relaying any piston force applied to it to the block it's bound to.
botania.page.pistonRelay1=To bind it to a block, right click it with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, and right click on the block you want to bind it to.<br>Furthermore, this block is highly unstable, and may create uncanny effects, care is to be taken, it is also resistant to glue, both in pulling and pushing. This allows for a "frame" like setup.
botania.page.pistonRelay2=Infusing a &1Piston&0 with &4Mana&0.

# -- MANA PYLON
botania.entry.pylon=Mana Pylon
botania.page.pylon0=A &1Mana Pylon&0 is a structure that can pull energies from the earth and use them to power enchanting processes.<br>For one, setting one adjanced to an &1Enchanting Table&0 as if it was a &1Bookshelf&0 will drastically increase the power it can convey, just 2 of these are enough for it to reach &4Level 30&0.
botania.page.pylon1=&oYou must construct additional pylons!&r

# -- MANA ENCHANTING
botania.entry.manaEnchanting=Enchanting with Mana
botania.page.manaEnchanting0=By utilizing the magical power emited from &1Mana Pylons&0, a structure that can enchant items with books without consuming them can be created, called the &1Mana Enchanteer&0.<br>Constructing one of these requires a fair amount of space and materials alike.
botania.page.manaEnchanting1=To construct the &1Mana Enchanter&0, one requires, as well as fair amount of space, 17 &1Obsidian&0 blocks, 10 &1Mystical Flowers&0 of any color, 6 &1Mana Pylons&0 and a &1Lapis Lazuli Block&0.<br>The instructions on how to assemble this structure are in the following pages.
botania.page.manaEnchanting2=Start by making an &1Obsidian&0 circle.
botania.page.manaEnchanting3=Put &1Mana Pylons&0 1 block in the air where marked.
botania.page.manaEnchanting4=Put flowers under the pylons and in the center
botania.page.manaEnchanting5=Place a &1Lapis Lazuli Block&0 in the center.
botania.page.manaEnchanting6=After the construct is done, right click the Lapis block with a &1Wand of the Forest&0 and the enchanter should form.<br>In order to utilize the enchanter, one would place (via right click) the item to be enchanted in the enchanter itself and drop &1Enchanted Books&0 inside the circle around it.
botania.page.manaEnchanting7=Items that are already enchanted can't be placed in the enchanter.<br>To start the enchanting, right click the enchanter with a &1Wand of the Forest&0. It'll scan the books around, and once it's done, a spell circle of sorts will appear around it, indicating the books can be safely picked up again.
botania.page.manaEnchanting8=After the enchanting begins, the enchanter will require &4Mana&0.<br>It can be fed via one of two ways, either via &4Mana Bursts&0 or nearby &1Mana Pools&0, the later being much faster, but a bit less efficient, as a small portion of the mana is lost.
botania.page.manaEnchanting9=When enough &4Mana&0 is gathered, the enchanting process will finalize, and the enchantments will be applied to the item.<br>The amount of &4Mana&0 required depends on the rarity of the enchantments being applied, their level, and the total amount of enchantments.<br>If any book has more than one enchantment, only the first will be accounted for.
botania.page.manaEnchanting10=During the enchanting process, the item can not be removed, but it can after the process has been completed.<br>Note that if at any point, any component of the construct is removed, it'll revert to it's original &1Lapis Lazuli Block&0 form.

# -- SPREADER TURNTABLE
botania.entry.turntable=Spreader Turntable
botania.page.turntable0=The &1Spreader Turntable&0, as it's name implies, can turn &1Mana Spreaders&0 around and around. Placing a spreader above the turntable will rotate it, given that a redstone signal isn't applied.<br>To change the speed of the turntable, right click with a &1Wand of the Forest&0, shift-right clicking will invert the movement.

# -- EYE OF THE ANCIENTS
botania.entry.forestEye=Eye of the Ancients
botania.page.forestEye0=As the Ancients who used to watch over the world always looked for the living beings on it, this block, the &1Eye of the Ancients&0, will do just that.<br>By attaching a &1Comparator&0 next to it, it'll send out a redstone signal equivalent to the amount of animals it can find.
botania.page.forestEye1=The counting only starts at 2, so, with 2 animals around, it'd output a signal of strength 1, with 3 animals, of strength 2 and so on.<br>Lastly, the time has worn down the sight of the Ancients, so this block can only see animals in about 6 blocks in any direction.
botania.page.forestEye2=Now you see me...

# -- OPEN CRATE
botania.entry.openCrate=Open Crate
botania.page.openCrate0=Sometimes devices like &1Droppers&0 or &1Dispensers&0 aren't precise or fast enough. A simple solution is to make a crate and punch a hole in the bottom.<br>Yeah, it's that simple. The &1Open Crate&0 accepts items from &1Hoppers&0 or any other means of inserting items, and obviously, drops them directly below it.
botania.page.openCrate1=A little interesting effect the &1Open Crate&0 can do is that, when given a redstone signal, any items it drops are prevented from being caught by flowers like the &1Hopperhock&0, &1Rannuncarpus&0 or &1Pollidisiac&0 for around ten seconds more than usual.
botania.page.openCrate2=A super crate box

# -- DRUM OF THE WILD
botania.entry.forestDrum=Drum of the Wild
botania.page.forestDrum0=The &1Drum of the Wild&0 is, in layman's terms, the percussion counterpart of the &1Horn of the Wild&0. It serves the exact same purpose as the handheld horn, but is placed in world.<br>To trigger a beat and break nearby folliage, one would fire a &4Mana Burst&0 at the drum.
botania.page.forestDrum1=It's to note that the drum does not store mana, hence, in order to trigger it, a &1Redstone Mana Spreader&0 or a &1Mana Blaster&0 is required.
botania.page.forestDrum2=But if you close your eyes...

# -- ABSTRUSE PLATFORM
botania.entry.platform=Abstruse Platform
botania.page.platform0=By laying &1Livingwood&0 on a very specific format it's possible to create a platform of sorts, that only has a physical body for whoever is on top of it and isn't sneaking. For anyone else, it's like it's not there. &4Mana Bursts&0 will always travel through it without any trouble.<br>It's also possible to camouflage this block as any other simple block by simply right clicking it.
botania.page.platform1=It would be Ethereal but the name was taken

# - MYSTICAL INSTRUMENTS
# -- MANA BLASTER
botania.entry.manaBlaster=Mana Blaster
botania.page.manaBlaster0=The &1Mana Blaster&0 is like a portable &1Mana Spreader&0, while shaped like a pistol for easy handling, it's not exactly a firearm, as much as it is just a portable spreader.<br>By utilizing &4Mana&0 from &4Mana carrying items&0 in the holder's inventory, it can shoot a mana burst when one is looking at.
botania.page.manaBlaster1=This burst is a bit different from the one fired from speaders, as it's faster, but carries only three quarters of the mana a spreader burst would. There's also a short cooldown period after firing the blaster until another burst can be shot.
botania.page.manaBlaster2=&1Mana Lenses&0 also function with the blaster, to attach one to it, put them side by side on a crafting table, to remove it, simply shift-right click the blaster.

# -- ROD THE LANDS
botania.entry.dirtRod=Rod of the Lands
botania.page.dirtRod0=The &1Rod of the Lands&0 is a rather simpleton tool, by utilizing &4Mana&0 from your inventory (via a &1Mana Tablet&0 or others), it can materialize and place a &1Dirt&0 block down.
botania.page.dirtRod1=That's dirty

# -- TERRA FIRMA ROD
botania.entry.terraformRod=Terra Firma Rod
botania.page.terraformRod0=While digging away at dirt with a shovel is definitely functional, flattening huge tracts of land can get somewhat tortuous at times.<br>By utilizing the &1Terra Firma Rod&0, it's possible to terraform in a quick and enviromental friendly manner.
botania.page.terraformRod1=This rod, will, at the cost of some &4Mana&0 from your inventory, flatten the land to the level you are standing. For this to happen, charge it by &4holding right-click&0 and, slowly but surely, the nearby terrain will be flattened to your level, either by placing &1Dirt&0 or by removing blocks.
botania.page.terraformRod2=Note that blocks removed by the rod are non-recuperable. The terrain will adapt to the changes as best as it can, up to a distance limit, to avoid cuts in hills and the like, for this, the flattening will work in the terrain's natural look.

botania.page.manaGear0=&1Manasteel&0, alike other metals, can be shaped into tools and armor alike.<br>Tools or armor crafted from this material will share their properties with &1Iron&0, albeit somewhat superior in enchantability and durability. Whenever a &1Manasteel&0 item is to take damage, if there's &4Mana&0 available in the inventory (such as a &1Mana Tablet&0), it'll use that instead.

botania.entry.terrasteelArmor=Terrasteel Armor
botania.page.terrasteelArmor0=Armor made out of &1Terrasteel&0, much alike the &1Manasteel&0 counterpart, can utilize &4Mana&0 from the inventory instead of taking damage.<br>This armor, however, has properties more alike &1Diamond&0 instead of &1Iron&0 and increases the wearer's health when worn.

# -- TERRA BLADE
botania.entry.terraSword=Terra Blade
botania.page.terraSword0=The &1Terra Blade&0, crafted from &1Terrasteel Ingots&0, is a sword infused with natural strength. Not only does it par with a &1Diamond Sword&0 in terms of strength and it uses &4Mana&0 from the inventory like &1Manasteel Tools&0, but when it's swinged, there's a chance for it to create a beam that will deal as much damage as a melee hit.
botania.page.terraSword1=No Broken Hero Sword

# -- TERRA SHATTERER
botania.entry.terraPick=Terra Shatterer
botania.page.terraPick0=The &1Terra Shatterer&0 is a tool that can amass insane quantities of mana on itself, due to the amount of &1Terrasteel&0 required for it's creation.<br>The tool functions very much like a &1Mana Tablet&0 by which it can amass &4Mana&0 by being tossed on a &1Mana Pool&0, it can't give the &4Mana&0 back, though, so it doesn't function as a storage method.
botania.page.terraPick1=The amount of &4Mana&0 stored on the tool defines it's &4Rank&0. Ranks go as follows: &4D&0, &4C&0, &4B&0, &4A&0, &4S&0, &4SS&0. &4D&0 being the default rank.<br>The amount of &4Mana&0 required to advance from rank to rank increases as the rank does. To advance from &4D&0 to &4C&0, for example, it requires just a few seconds of exposition to a &1Mana Pool&0.
botania.page.terraPick2=To advance from rank &4C&0 to rank &4B&0, a full &1Mana Pool&0 is required, and the cost increases by a tenfold per rank from there on in, all the way to &4SS&0.<br>The rank of the tool does not change it's speed, but instead, it increases the power of it's &4Active Ability&0.<br>Toggling the tool's ability can be done via right click.
botania.page.terraPick3=While the tool is active, it enables it to break blocks in an extended area. At rank &4C&0 it's a small column, which increases to a square at rank &4B&0, that gets larger trough the ranks. It's to note that the rank &4D&0 tool does not have the active ability.<br>Having the tool active consumes &4Mana&0 from it's storage passively, even if not being used to mine.
botania.page.terraPick4=Lastly, the tool takes damage for every single block broken, so a good supply of &4Mana&0 in the wielder's inventory is a must for the higher ranks, as the tool does function like normal &1Manasteel Tools&0, in which it'll use &4Mana&0 instead of actually taking damage, given it's made of &1Terrasteel&0.<br>It also won't despawn like regular dropped items.
botania.page.terraPick5=Stronger than a Gastrea

# -- SOULSCRIBE
botania.entry.enderDagger=Soulscribe
botania.page.enderDagger0=Those &4Endermen&0. They're the second more pesky thing since &4Creepers&0. I swear, the person who came up with them must have taken a &onotch&r too much of their drink.<br>However, by infusing a standard dagger with some of their energy, one can create the &1Soulscribe&0, a dagger that tears through &1Endermen&0 as if they were butter.
botania.page.enderDagger1=Due of the type of infusion, though, the dagger only lasts for a few kills, and the energy that radiates from it prevents the &1Manasteel&0 from gathering &4Mana&0 to avoid damage, like typical tools would. Still, all in the name of killing those monsters.

# -- RING OF CHORDATA
botania.entry.waterRing=Ring of Chordata
botania.page.waterRing0=The &1Ring of Chordata&0 allows the wearer to swim like a fish. While it's equipped, the wearer is bestowed with the ability to accelarate to a decent speed while underwater. It also gives the wearer good sight underwater and, if &4Mana&0 is present, at the cost of some of it, the ability to breathe indefinitely.
botania.page.waterRing1=Go swim with the fishes

# -- RING OF THE MANTLE
botania.entry.miningRing=Ring of the Mantle
botania.page.miningRing0=The &1Ring of the Mantle&0 allows one to mine faster, while equipped and &4Mana&0 is present in the inventory, it'll give a &4Haste&0 effect to the wearer.
